# ====== Simple Rain Forecasting ======
The objective about this project is to predict wheter tomorrow willbe rain or not default based on several parameters. Because I am not an expert in meteorology and climatology domain, to prevent bias in choosing the threshold, I will make the result of this app beside from binary classification also add a percentage of posibilty default. With this simple app, People will be more easy to predict will be rain or not tomorrow.
The Dataset is from Daily weather observations from multiple locations around Australia, obtained from the Australian Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology and processed to create this realtively large sample dataset for illustrating analytics.
